Here is the first polygon task. Training images contain random
polygons ranging from triangles (3 corners) up to polygons with 10
corners. The polygons are "easy" in the sence that two corners are not
too close to each other and that angles in the polygons are not too
close to 180 degrees.

The folders polyAll-trn and polyAll-tst contain training and test
images, respectively. The files 'polyAll-trn_trg.csv' and
'polyAll-tst_trg.csv' contain info regarding the number of corners for
each file.

The python script 'polygon_read.py' contain function to read the image
data.
